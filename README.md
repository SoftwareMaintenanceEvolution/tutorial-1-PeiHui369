# Introduction
Hi! I'm Lee Pei Hui, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course. 
This semester, I'm deep-diving into the critical challenges of **software maintenance** and working with **legacy systems**. This course directly complements my testing background by focusing on system longevity and quality evolution.

- **Fun fact**: I love hiking though I'm acrophobia
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in maintaining and evolving software.
