# Introduction
Hi! I'm Lee Pei Hui, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course. 
This semester, I expect to learn the critical challenges of **software maintenance** and work with **legacy systems**. This course directly complements my testing background by focusing on system longevity and quality evolution.

- **Fun fact**: I love hiking though I'm acrophobia.
- **Course expectations**: I'm here to dive into the trenches of codebase transformation! My core expectation is to master the art of software evolution, turning legacy code into modern, maintainable systems and proving my testing skills are the blueprint for sustainable growth.
